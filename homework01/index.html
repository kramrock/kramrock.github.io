            <P>I'm a novice coder with a knack for finding the hard way to do things.  I plan for that to change as the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp continues, and I continue to learn.  I am a graduate of the U of M Twin Cities, earning a BA in political science in 2012.  During my time at the U, I was a member of the marching band, and a member of the Omega Nu Alpha Fraternity.  I thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate experience.
            </P>
            <P>In my life away from coding and the U of M, I am a father to an awesome almost 13 year old named Aiden, I have a great lady in my life named Nichole, and I am big on spending time with them and the rest of our families.  I attend Gopher football games, MNUFC soccer matches, I play a lot of golf, I play a little bit of tennis, and I just kind of exist the rest of the time.</P>
            <P>I'm grateful to have the opportunity to take part in this coding bootcamp.  I hope that with hard work, and maximum effort, that great things will come of this.</P>
