This program uses javascript in order to randomly generate a password for the user.  

Upon opening the site the user has the option to choose to include capital letters, lowercase letters, or special characters.  The user also has the option to choose between 8 and 128 characters for their password.

After the user makes the choices, the user will be given a password that shows up in the textbox as html takes over the page. 

Finally, the user is able to copy their new password to the clipboard via the "copy to clipboard" button.
